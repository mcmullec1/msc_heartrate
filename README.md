Welcome to my MSc project! The goal of this project is to provide a platform for the Sports and Exercise Department at the University of Roehampton to access and view live heart-rate data from multiple Bluetooth enabled heart rate monitors. I plan to document the process through this git repo so please feel free to check in for regular updates!
