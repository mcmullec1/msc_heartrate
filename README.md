# MSc Real-Time Display of Heart Rate Monitor Data ♥️
### Clare McMullen

Welcome to my MSc project! The goal of this project is to provide a platform for the Sports and Exercise Department at the University of Roehampton to access and view live heart rate data from multiple Bluetooth enabled heart rate monitors. I plan to document the process through this git repo so please feel free to check in for regular updates!

This repository includes the following files and folders:

##### hr_website 💻
- a sub-repository that includes the code for the functioning website

##### Personas 👤
- three personas of potential users and use cases

##### Flow Chart 📈
- a diagram that outlines the flow of the website and how the user will interact with the site

##### User Interview 🎙️
- an informal interview of feedback after providing wireframes to the intended user

##### Proposal 📄
- the project proposal including signatures from the supervisor and myself

##### Meeting Notes ✏️
- a short summary of each supervisor meeting
