# MSc Real-Time Display of Heart-Rate Monitor Data
### Clare McMullen

Welcome to my MSc project! The goal of this project is to provide a platform for the Sports and Exercise Department at the University of Roehampton to access and view live heart-rate data from multiple Bluetooth enabled heart rate monitors. I plan to document the process through this git repo so please feel free to check in for regular updates!

This repository includes the following files and folders:

##### hr_website
- a sub-repository that includes the code for the functioning website

##### Personas
- three personas of potential users and use cases

##### Flow Chart
- a diagram that outlines the flow of the website and how the user will interact with the site

##### User Interview
- an informal interview of feedback after providing wireframes to the intended user

##### Proposal
- the project proposal including signatures from the supervisor and myself
